RL / AI research engineer with a preliminary background in mechatronics and solid foundation in robotics integration and reinforcement learning. My Master’s degree work at Carnegie Mellon University includes developing motion planning subsystems for a [wearable robot arm](/coborg.md), [enhancing state-of-the-art perception and multimodal models](https://vlrproject.wordpress.com/) such as Centerpoint 3D object detection, and [scene graph generation for training multimodel visual question answering models](/assets/pdf/gqa.pdf).

I am currently applying self-play reinforcement learning to train driving agents to navigate and complete tasks in logistics yards.
