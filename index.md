RL / AI research engineer with a preliminary background in mechatronics and a solid foundation in robotics integration and reinforcement learning. My Masterâ€™s degree work at Carnegie Mellon University includes developing motion planning subsystems for a [wearable robot arm](/_pages/coborg.md), [enhancing state-of-the-art perception and multimodal models](https://vlrproject.wordpress.com/) such as Centerpoint 3D object detection, and [scene graph generation for training multimodel visual question answering models](/assets/pdf/gqa.pdf). 

During my time at Forterra, I applied [Gaussian Mixture Probability Hypothesis Density Filters]((https://ba-ngu.vo-au.com/vo/VM_GMPHD_SP06.pdf)) in addition to utilizing [Motion Segmentation with Event Cameras]((https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.01293)) to improve multi-object tracking within the companies use-cases. I am currently applying self-play reinforcement learning to train driving agents to navigate and complete tasks in logistics yards.
