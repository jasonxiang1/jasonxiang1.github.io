RL / AI research engineer with a preliminary background in mechatronics and solid foundation in robotics integration and reinforcement learning. My Masterâ€™s degree work at Carnegie Mellon University includes developing motion planning subsystems for a wearable robot arm, enhancing state-of-the-art perception and multimodal models such as Centerpoint 3D object detection, and scene graph generation for training multimodel visual question answering models.

I am currently applying self-play reinforcement learning to train driving agents to navigate and complete tasks in logistics yards.
