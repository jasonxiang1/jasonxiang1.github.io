# Introduction

As a research engineer at ISEE AI, my passion lies in building the foundational systems that enable intelligent agents to learn, reason, and operate effectively in complex environments. This involves working across the full R&D lifecycle, from exploring new learning paradigms to conducting rigorous, data-driven analysis required to understand and advance model capabilities. I am driven by the challenge of ambitious, high-impact research and thrive on solving the fundamental problems that emerge when building the next generation of AI from the ground up.
