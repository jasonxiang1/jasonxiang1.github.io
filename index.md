# Introduction

I am an RL / AI research engineer with a preliminary background in mechatronics and a solid foundation in robotics integration and reinforcement learning. My Masterâ€™s degree experience at Carnegie Mellon University includes developing motion planning subsystems for a [wearable robot arm](/pages/coborg.md), enhancing state-of-the-art [3D perception models](https://vlrproject.wordpress.com/), and utilizing [scene graphs as an additional modality for Visual Question Answering (VQA)](/pages/gqa.md) tasks. 

During my time at Forterra, I applied [Gaussian Mixture Probability Hypothesis Density Filters](https://ba-ngu.vo-au.com/vo/VM_GMPHD_SP06.pdf) in addition to utilizing [Motion Segmentation with Event Cameras](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.01293) to improve multi-object tracking speed and fidelity. I am currently integrating self-play reinforcement learning policies to train driving agents in non-stationary, multi-agent environments.
