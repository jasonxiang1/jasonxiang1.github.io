## ISEE AI
Reinforcement Learning Engineer
Jun. 2022
Present
Atlanta, GA
Led training of human-like, end-to-end RL policies to perform driving tasks in cluttered real-world sites
Designed roadmaps to train RL policies with specified end performance metrics
Created PyTorch simulation environment to output over 200k training steps per second
Achieved benchmark performance within 15% of existing MPC implementation
Enhanced risk-averse behavior by integrating hindsight reward modules to enforce strict safety constraints without expensive forward look-ahead compute
Applied state-of-the-art, on-policy transformer models with a focus on improving real-time decision making in partially observable environments
