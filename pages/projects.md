# [Backpack-Mounted Third Robot Arm](/coborg.md)
- Led motion planning subsystem in C++ for 4-DOF wearable robotic arm to assist field technicians installing overhead panels
- Developed multi-stage pipeline to transition from end-effector position to force control, using MoveIt and Octomap in ROS Melodic framework
- Implemented stabilization algorithm using resolved rate controller to compensate for user motion (up to 6” translation and 90° rotation)
- Achieved 84.62% task and 100.00% safety success rate while installing panels weighing up to 15 lbs

# [Adding Scene Graph Modalities to Visual Question Answering (VQA) Models](/gqa.md)
- Designed scene graph (i.e. contextual relationship map) generation pipeline using MotifNet and bottom-up attention networks
- Finetuned and improved GraphVQA accuracy by 11% in scene graph deficient test sets

# [Joint Object Detection and Attribute Prediction to CenterPoint](https://vlrproject.wordpress.com/)
- Extended [CenterPoint 3D detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11275) model to jointly predict object attributes with detections
- Fine-tuned model with NuScenes autonomous driving LiDAR dataset augmented with attribute labels
- Achieved 83% average precision for vehicle and pedestrian object-attribute pairs
