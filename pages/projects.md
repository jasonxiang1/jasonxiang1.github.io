# [Backpack-Mounted Third Robot Arm](/coborg.md)
- Developed backpack robot arm to assist field technicians performing panel installation tasks
- Achieved stable end-effector positioning under human motion (up to 6" translation, 90Â° rotation)
- Integrated Intel RealSense cameras and HEBI actuators using ROS Melodic framework
- Programmed force feedback control in C++ for safe robot interaction in dynamic environments

# [Adding Scene Graph Modalities to Visual Question Answering (VQA) Models](/gqa.md)
- Evaluated scene graph and object attribute generation pipelines (Neural Motifs, bottom-up attention) for GraphVQA model
- Improved VQA performance across various multimodal architectures by up to 10% using scene graph modalities in data augmentation and pre-training
